- **Real-time Traffic Capture**: Continuous network traffic monitoring using tcpdump
- **Multi-layer Analysis**:
  - Signature-based detection using Snort 3
  - Behavioral analysis using machine learning
  - Flow-based analysis with PyFlowMeter
- **Advanced ML Detection**:
  - XGBoost-based classification
  - PCA for feature reduction
  - Comprehensive feature extraction
- **Automated Alert System**:
  - Email notifications for critical alerts
  - Detailed alert logging and history
- **Web Interface**:
  - Real-time monitoring dashboard
  - Historical data visualization
  - Alert management system

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd [repository-name]
```

2. Install required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure Snort:
```bash
sudo cp /etc/snort/snort.lua /etc/snort/snort.lua.backup
sudo cp /etc/snort/rules/local.rules /etc/snort/rules/local.rules.backup
```

4. Setup PyFlowMeter:
```bash
cd pyflowmeter
python -m venv pyflowmeter_env
source pyflowmeter_env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Place your ML models in the `Models&&scaler&&PCA/` directory:
   - scaler.pkl
   - pca.pkl
   - Multi_classification_XGBoost_depth_6.pkl

## üíª Running the System

The system requires three terminal windows running as root. Open three terminal windows and run the following commands:

### Terminal 1 - Main System
```bash
sudo python3 main.py
```
This starts the main system which handles:
- Network traffic capture
- Snort analysis
- Web interface

### Terminal 2 - ML Processor
```bash
sudo python3 ml_processor.py
```
This runs the machine learning component which:
- Processes network flows
- Performs anomaly detection
- Generates predictions

### Terminal 3 - Alert System
```bash
sudo python3 gmail_alert.py
```
This manages the alert system which:
- Processes security alerts
- Sends email notifications
- Maintains alert history

## üìä System Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture with the following components:

1. **Traffic Capture Module**:
   - Real-time packet capture using tcpdump
   - Automatic file rotation and management

2. **Analysis Pipeline**:
   - Snort-based signature detection
   - PyFlowMeter flow analysis
   - Machine learning-based anomaly detection

3. **Alert Management**:
   - Email notification system
   - Alert logging and storage
   - Alert history tracking

4. **Web Interface**:
   - Real-time monitoring dashboard
   - Historical data analysis
   - Alert management interface
